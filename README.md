# Speedrun Reset Optimization

This project implements an algorithm for optimising reset strategies in speedrunning.
This is not only usefull for determining when to reset during a run, but also it allows one quantitatively judge when to go for a risky strategy or for a more safe one.

## The basic idea

!(model_drawing.png)

I intend on explaining this model and why it works in more mathematical rigour in a LaTeX document.

## Getting started

At the moment this project consists of just python code and cannot really be exported.
All the python code is contained in the PyCharm project ResetOptimizationCode.
The full algorithm is contained in the files `speedrun_models.py` and `reset_strategies.py`.
Example code is provded in `example_code.py`.
Only the numpy library is needed to run the code.
